Personal Project(2022):
    Art: Enemy(simply created in Unity), Assets(Particles, UI, Background, Sound), Animation
    Programming: Ball movement, Enemy navigation, General Systems, UI and Particle effects

Controls:
    WASD - Movement
    Space - Jump

How to Reach the Goal:
    Touch the SuperJump - Jump higher
    Collect the Lemon (Key) - Break obstacle
    Collect Other Fruits - Earn points

Tools:
    Unity - The game engine used to implement the ball game
    Visual Sudio Code - Used to edit scripts

Dev Journey:
    I reviewed the code while uploading it just to keep a record. I remember putting a lot of effort into experimenting with Unity navigation, animations, and other elements. I also tried to apply different particle systems for each fruit. Also, this might have been my first time implementing UI in a game. Although the scripts were unnecessarily divided and the hierarchy was poorly organized, I recall this being the first game I created from start to finish. Compared to now, some parts are cleaner, but scalability is still an area that needs more practice. ðŸ˜‚
